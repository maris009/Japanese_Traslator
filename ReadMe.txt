Project was done in part, parser part, follow by scanner part, and all put together for the translator part.

Use parser.cpp to do your parser so that
it will move smoothly onto the translator.

Use the provided test cases - read the comments in them first.
Be sure to check correctoutput for cases 1 and 6.
Be sure to check OutputEC.txt for case 2 and 3 error correction for EC.


Compile your Parser on Empress!!!
